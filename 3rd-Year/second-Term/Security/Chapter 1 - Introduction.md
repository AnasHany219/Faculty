# 🛡️ Introduction to Cryptographic and Network Security 🌐

## Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols 🗝️

- **Symmetric Encryption:** 🛡️
  - Conceals data blocks, ensuring secrecy for messages and encryption keys.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** 🔒
  - Safeguards small data blocks, like encryption keys, with enhanced security.
- **Data Integrity Algorithms:** 🛡️🔒
  - Shields data blocks, such as messages, from unauthorized alteration.
- **Authentication Protocols:** 🤝🔐
  - Confirms the identity of entities, securing communication channels.
# Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) 🕵️‍♂️🔐

   - **Computer Security:** Safeguards automated information systems ensuring integrity, availability, and confidentiality. 🖥️
## Confidentiality 🤫
##### Data Confidentiality: 🛡️
- Guards against unauthorized access to private information.
##### Privacy: 👤
- Empowers individuals to control their data.
## Integrity 🛡️
##### Data Integrity: 🔒
- Ensures the integrity of information and programs.
##### System Integrity: 🖥️
- Safeguards system functionality from malicious tampering.
## Availability 🕒
- Ensures rapid system operation and service availability to authorized users.
## Accountability 📝
- Imposes traceability on system actions for enhanced security. 🕵️‍♂️
## Authenticity 🔏
- Provides verification and trust in transmitted data and its origin. ✅

## Security Attack: 
  `Any action compromising the security of an organization's information.`
##### Passive Attack
- Enables adversaries to access and recognize message content, ensuring its integrity.

## Security Service:
  `A process that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organization.`
- **Authentication:** Validates the authenticity of communicating entities.
- **Access Control:** Restricts unauthorized usage of resources.
- **Data Confidentiality:** Safeguards sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures data remains unaltered and trustworthy.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Prevents parties from denying their actions in communication.
- **Availability:** Ensures resources remain accessible and operational.

## Security Mechanism:
  `Designed to detect, prevent, or recover from security breaches. `
- **Encipherment:** Protects data by converting it into ciphertext. 🔒
- **Digital Signatures:** Ensures the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. 📝✍️
- **Access Controls:** Regulates access to resources based on predefined policies. 🚪🔒
- **Data Integrity:** Verifies the accuracy and completeness of data. 🛡️✅
- **Authentication Exchange:** Establishes the identity of communicating parties. 🤝🔏
- **Traffic Padding:** Conceals patterns in network traffic to enhance security. 🛡️🔒
- **Routing Control:** Manages and secures network traffic routing paths. 🛣️🔐
- **Notarization:** Provides timestamping and verification services for digital documents. 🕰️📄
